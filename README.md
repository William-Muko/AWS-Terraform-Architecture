# AWS Terraform Web Infrastructure 

## Overview
This repository contains a Terraform module that provisions a **highly available, scalable, and secure web application infrastructure** on AWS. It's a perfect playground for beginners to understand core AWS services and for practitioners to solidify their Terraform skills.

## What You'll Build

By applying this Terraform code, you will create a modern AWS architecture that includes:

*   **A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):** Your own logically isolated network.
*   **Public Subnets:** Spread across two Availability Zones for high availability.
*   **Security Groups:** Acting as virtual firewalls to control traffic to your ALB and EC2 instances.
*   **An Application Load Balancer (ALB):** To efficiently distribute incoming web traffic.
*   **A Target Group:** To route requests from the ALB to healthy instances.
*   **A Launch Template:** Defining the blueprint for your web servers (Amazon Linux 2023 with Apache Web Server Defined in the **Userdata Script**).
*   **An Auto Scaling Group (ASG):** To automatically maintain and scale the number of healthy web instances.
